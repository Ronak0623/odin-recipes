  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <h5>For Pizza Dough</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 ounces bread flour, plus more for dusting (638g; about 4 1/2 cups)</li>
    <li>0.5 ounce granulated sugar (15g; about 1 1/2 tablespoons)</li>
    <li>0.35 ounce kosher salt (10g; about 1 tablespoon)</li>
    <li>0.35 ounce dry instant yeast (10g; about 2 teaspoons)</li>
    <li>15 ounces lukewarm water (415g; about 1 3/4 cups)</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>For Pizza Sauce</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>28 oz can of San Marzano tomatoes</li>
    <li>4 cloves of garlic (grated)</li>
    <li>salt, pepper, dried oregano and a pinch of sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Other Ingredients</h5>
  <ul>
  <li>1 pound freshly grated full-fat dry mozzarella cheese (454g; about 4 cups), placed in freezer for at least 15 minutes</li>
  <li>fresh basil</li>
  <li>freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
  
<h4>Instructions</h4>
  <ol>
   <li>Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in bowl or stand mixer. Incorporate everything together for about 1 minute. Add water and olive oil. Run the stand mixer until mixture forms ball that rides around the bowl above the blade. If combining by hand, combine until the dough stop sticking all over your fingers.</li>
   <li>Transfer dough ball to lightly floured surface and knead once or twice by hand until smooth ball is formed. Divide dough into three even portions and place each in a covered quart-sized deli container. Place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least 1 day, and up to 3. The longer you let it proof or rise the better your dough will turn out.</li>
   <li>At least two hours before baking, remove dough from refrigerator and shape into balls by gathering dough towards bottom and pinching shut. Flour well and place each dough ball in a separate medium mixing bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at warm room temperature until roughly doubled in volume.</li>
   <li>One hour before baking, adjust oven rack with pizza stone to middle position and preheat oven to 500 degrees. Turn single dough ball out onto lightly floured surface. Gently press out dough into rough 8-inch circle, leaving outer inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough by draping over knuckles to form a 12- to 14-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to pizza peel.</li>
   <li>For your sauce process the can of san marzano tomatoes and their juice through food mill, pulse in food processor until puréed, or purée with immersion blender. Purée should not be completely smooth,but should have no chunks larger than 1/16th of an inch. Afterwards add your salt, pepper, dried oregano and sugar to taste and that is your pizza sauce. We will not be cooking the sauce down since it will cook with the pizza.</li>
   <li>Spread approximately 2/3 cup sauce evenly over surface of crust, leaving 1/2- to 1-inch border along edge. Evenly spread 1/3 of cheese over sauce. Slide pizza onto baking stone and bake until cheese is melted with some browned spots and crust is golden brown and puffed, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to cutting board, slice, and serve immediately topped with some fresh basil and freshly grated parmesan cheese. Repeat with remaining two dough balls, remaining sauce, and remaining cheese.</li>
  </ol>
